# Simple-Q-A-bot
A simple Streamlit chat interface for Google's Gemini model using the Generative AI API.

The project aims to make AI-driven knowledge access simple, fast, and interactive. Users can ask any question from general topics like science and history to domain-specific queries and get contextually accurate answers in real time.

This bot demonstrates the power of Generative AI in understanding natural language, retrieving relevant information, and producing human-like responses. It can serve as the foundation for chatbots, AI assistants, customer support systems, or educational tools.

# How it Works
- The Gemini API processes the text using its large language model (LLM) capabilities — interpreting meaning, context, and intent.
- Streamlit provides a user-friendly web interface where users can type in their questions.
- The response is sent back to Streamlit and displayed instantly in a conversational format.

In short
User Question → Gemini API (AI Model) → AI-generated Answer → Displayed in Streamlit UI
